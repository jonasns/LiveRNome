#Readme
#-t: Specify feature type in GTF annotation. Here I chose exon, because on transcript level we might not get the lncRNAs
#-g: Specify attribute type in GTF annotation. Here we could chose e.g. transcript ID or gene ID. I chose gene ID, because I want to do DE analysis on gene level.
#-s: use '-s 2' if reversely stranded (as is the case for the Illumina Truseq library prep protocol)
#-T: Number of computational cores/threads used for the analysis
#-p: The experiment is paired end
#-M: Multi-mapping reads will also be counted. Each alignment will have 1 count or a fractional count if --fraction is specified
#-O: Allow reads that overlaps multiple features to be counted
#-C: If specified, the chimeric fragments (those fragments that have their two ends aligned to different chromosomes) will NOT be counted.
#-a: Name of the annotation file. Here it's gencode v27 chr1-22 (e.g. no M, X, or Y chromosomes). Additionally the two novel genes MSTRG.28468 and MSTRG.12891 has been added manually.
#-o: output file name
